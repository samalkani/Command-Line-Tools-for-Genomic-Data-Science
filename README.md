# Command-Line-Tools-for-Genomic-Data-Science

Use of command line tools for managing genomic data. Including basic Unix commands for managing files and directories, followed by a review of the main standardized data formats, use popular tools such as Samtools, Bedtools, Bowtie, and application specific technologies such as Bcftools and Cufflinks.
